This Haskell code exhibits a common error related to monadic operations and function purity.  The function `calculateTax` attempts to modify a mutable variable (`taxRate`) within a monadic context (using `modifyIORef`), but this approach is not idiomatic Haskell and can lead to unexpected behavior or race conditions if used concurrently. Furthermore, impure functions within pure functions can cause issues.
